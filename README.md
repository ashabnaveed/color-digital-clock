# color-digital-clock
This simple python code will run and display a digital clock that shows the current time. The background will be colored based off the time of when the code was run.
Click run and view the change in color at certain times of day! Note most colours are quite dark, as the color utilizes hex codes based off the time in the format hour
minute, second. Thus, the maximum colour available is #235959 at 11:59 PM, and the lowest color is #000000, at 12:00 AM (Or it may be #240000), depending on how
Tkinter reads the time at 12:00.
